The three subfolders are older stuff which you can read about
in their respective READMEs. The scripts around here are the
final analyses which I conducted to find optimal parameters.

Short Version:
-
To get the optimal parameter groups, for each observation
sequence you're interested in:
- Run SNR_scoring.py within the analysis folder of the
folder corresponding to the observation sequence
- Run contrast_scoring.py (within analysis folder)
- Run overall_scoring.py (within analysis folder)

Then move "parameterranking.py" out to the main folder which
contains subfolders corresponding to each observation
sequence, and run it with the names of each observation
sequence as command line arguments; e.g. 
```python parameterranking.py HD1160 HR8799 KB Kappa```.
Then run "collapse_pr.py" with each number of KL modes per
parameter set that you are interested in. The number of KL
modes is a command line argument, e.g. ```python collapse_pr
.py 2``` to get a file where you get all the scores for a
given parameter set based on the group of 2 values of KL
modes which admits the best threshold. Then run
"optimalgroups.py" (or, preferably, opis, if it gets
fixed), on the output file of "collapse_pr"
and you're done. These scripts do require various command
line arguments as well which you can read about in the
comments to them.

Additional Info:
-
The scripts "SNR_scoring.py" and "contrast_scoring.py" 
generate two scores, the first of which is derived from the 
SNRs of the fake planets after pyKLIP has been run, and the
latter being derived from the calibrated contrast of the 
image at certain separations after pyKLIP has been run. 
These two produce seperate CSVs which are linked together 
into a single CSV file via "overall_scoring.py".

The script "parameterranking.py" takes the contrast and SNR
scores of the individual star systems, and synthesizes them
into a single CSV file where the columns are the parameters
along with their respective rankings on each score compared
to the other parameters.

The script "optimalgroups.py" is the finishing touch on 
getting the ideal parameter sets. It looks at the CSV file
generated by "parameterranking.py" and investigates possible
groups of parameter sets, measuring the threshold for each. 
The threshold refers to the minimum value such that for 
every star system's SNR and contrast scores, at least one of
the parameter sets in the group scores at or above the
threshold. This script, however, is horribly inefficient 
both in terms of memory used and in terms of computation 
time. In practice, this makes that script unusuable for
examining groups of more than 2 parameter sets. To solve 
these problems, I devised the more nicer algorithm 
which I implemented in "opis.py". This script had worked for
me previously (Summer 2022) but has not been working for me
recently (Spring 2023) due to an error out of lines 88 & 89 
or lines 96 & 97. In either case, line 88/96 is intended to
add an additional row onto the DataFrame we are working with.
While this works most of the time, recently I have found that
occasionally line 88/96 will _replace_ the last row instead
of appending a row, which then (intentionally) causes a
value error to arise in line 89/97. It seems that fixing this
one issue would allow the "opis.py" script to be used.
