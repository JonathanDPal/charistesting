Some scripts I used for plots for Lyot & SPIE. Two of them
generate 2D heatmaps with annuli and KL modes as vertical and
horizonal axes and either contrast or SNR score as the coloring, 
one generates a median contrast curve for a particular value
of movement, and the final one generates a scatter plot where
the x and y axes are contrast/snr scores and the points are
colored by the (sum of) SNR(s) of science target(s) in the
image.
