One note on these -- these were created out of an older version of parameterprobing.py so I wouldn't recommend just using one of these with a couple tweaks;
I'd strongly recommend using the parameterprobing.py script in the main directory so that you get the latest version. You might/probably will run into bugs
if you use these.
