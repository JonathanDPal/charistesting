One note on these -- these were created out of an older version of parameterprobing.py so I wouldn't recommend trying to use one of them with a couple modifications; I'd strongly recommend using the parameterprobing.py script in the main directory so that you get the latest version. You might/probably will run into bugs if you use these. I'm just including them for illustrative purposes.
