This is a set of scripts that I wrote in order to determine some more or less optimal parameters for running pyKLIP on data from CHARIS. See [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yX0l96IZs1IxxKCRmriVSAQM3KFGF9U1-FnpJXhcLXo/edit?usp=sharing](url) for some information on how to use it. pyKLIP documentation can be found here: [pyklip.readthedocs.io](url)
